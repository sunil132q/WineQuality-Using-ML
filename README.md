# WineQuality-Using-ML
The Wine Quality Project is a data science initiative that focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. It typically uses datasets that contain various chemical features of wine samples (such as acidity, sugar content, pH, alcohol percentage, etc.) alongside a quality score rated by wine tasters.
